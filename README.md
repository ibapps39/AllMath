# AllMath
## A fun, functional, and broad math library. 
### The Goal?
  - My goal at the moment is to have a variety of mathematical models, functions, and maybe even visual outputs!
### What's your favorite mathematical concept, field, or equation?
  - Abstract Algebra is probably what I have always found the most interesting, additionally anything involving physics (applied and theoretical) and Prime numbers.
  - Linear Algebra is hard to not see all around us. It's used in everything from Calculus, Finance/Economics, Games, and such much more!
  - The Fourier Series Zeta Function in terms of an equation.

## Format
  - I intend to use only C. If I really enjoy making something, I may also take a jab at making it in other languages. I really don't want to this to be bloated with other libraries or get too complex.
  - Overall, think of this as any other C library. Basically, just files and their headers. 
  - UNIX style apporach when it comes too any and all functions. Do one thing and do it well. 
  - While pontentially lowfty, I'd like to challenge myself to keep this as purely functional as possible. Haskell like but I prefer and know C better than Haskell.    Little to no side-effects.
  - Any and all C files and headers will reside in the primary folder. Anything that isn't C releated or Makefiles. Visual tools I create will be stored in a seperate folder and are not the primary aim of this project.
  - Any and all code contributed, from .lang to their headers, and all visual libraries incorperated or contributed (made from scratch or third party), should be compatible with GPL 2.0.
## Can I help, contribute, or otherwise use this?
  - While I intend to keep this a personal project, and since there are many great libraries out there I would at all expect this to be used seriously. It's just meant to be fun, for me and anyone else. That said, this is entirely open-source. If you see something I missed, want to make a suggestion, or even want to help, please do. 
    - I am especially open to anyone wanting to contribute something in a language other than C. That said, C is the first and foremost primary language of the project. This is in terms of developement of the library, visual tools, and files. 
  - In terms of using it for your own stuff, while I'll likely be 100% fine with whatever it is you're using it for, please read up and abide to the license.

## Roadmap
  - First up: Elementary Algebra, Geometry, Linear Algebra, and Calculus (AB level, then BC, and then as much as I can!).

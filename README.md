# AllMath
## A fun, functional, and broad math library. 
### The Goal?
  - My goal at the moment is to have a variety of mathematical models, functions, and maybe even visual outputs!
  - First up: Elementary Algebra, Geometry, Linear Algebra, and Calculus (AB level, then BC, and then as much as I can!). 
### What's your favorite mathematical concept, field, or equation?
  - Abstract Algebra is probably what I have always found the most interesting, additionally anything involving physics (applied and theoretical) and Prime numbers.
  - Linear Algebra is hard to not see all around us. It's used in everything from Calculus, Finance/Economics, Games, and such much more!
  - The Fourier Series Zeta Function in terms of an equation.
